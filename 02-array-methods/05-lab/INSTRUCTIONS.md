# Peaks Lab

In this activity, we want to answer some questions about our data.

## Which Peaks?

- Are some peaks over the elevation of 10,000?
- Are some peaks under the elevation of 5,000?
- Which peaks are over elevation of 10,000?

## Find Peaks

- Create a function called findPeak which finds a peak by name
- Create a higher order function that can be used to find a peak over any elevation and another to find peaks under any elevation.
  - Check to see if every peak is over 5000ft
  - Produce an array of only peaks over 9500ft
